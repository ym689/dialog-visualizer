Would you like some action, comedy, or something else?"}, {'role': 'Seeker', 'content': "Hey! I'm down for anything, really. But I've been watching a lot of sci-fi lately.

What do you think?"}, {'role': 'Recommender', 'content': "Sci-fi is a great choice! I think you might enjoy Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.

What else do you have in mind? What's the plot of this other movie you're thinking of?"}, {'role': 'Recommender', 'content': "I was thinking of Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. It's a classic in the Star Wars franchise, and it's a great standalone movie. The plot follows the Rebel Alliance as they try to destroy the Death Star. It's a really iconic movie with a lot of memorable moments."}, {'role': 'Seeker', 'content': "Wait, isn't that part of the Star Wars franchise too? I'm trying to avoid getting too invested in a huge franchise. I want something that's a bit more... standalone. What else do you have?"}, {'role': 'Recommender', 'content': "I understand your concern. Let me ask you, are you open to watching a movie that's a bit older, or do you prefer something more recent?"}, {'role': 'Seeker', 'content': "I'm good with either, to be honest. I just want to make sure it's something I'll enjoy. What's this older movie you're thinking of?"}, {'role': 'Recommender', 'content': 'I was thinking of "This Beautiful Fantastic" (2016).

I\'ve never heard of it before.'}, {'role': 'Recommender', 'content': '"This Beautiful Fantastic" is about a young woman who dreams of being a children\'s author and makes an unlikely friendship with a cantankerous, rich old widower.

I'm not really in the mood for a romantic comedy. I was thinking more along the lines of sci-fi or action. But I appreciate the recommendation. What else do you have?"}, {'role': 'Recommender', 'content': 'I\'d like to ask, what specifically about romantic comedies doesn\'t appeal to you? Is it the genre itself, or is there something specific about "This Beautiful Fantastic" that didn\'t resonate with you?'}, {'role': 'Seeker', 'content': "I guess I just don't really connect with the genre. I mean, I've seen a few rom-coms before, but they just don't really do it for me. I'm more of a sci-fi and action kind of guy. But hey, thanks for trying to recommend something!"}, {'role': 'Recommender', 'content': "No worries at all! I appreciate your honesty.
