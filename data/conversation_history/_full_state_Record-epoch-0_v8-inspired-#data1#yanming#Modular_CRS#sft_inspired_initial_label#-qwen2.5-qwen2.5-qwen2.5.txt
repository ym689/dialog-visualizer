I usually watch movies when I have some free time, but I haven\'t found anything that caught my interest lately.

It has a high IMDb rating of 7.1/10 and a positive Rotten Tomatoes score of 82%.\nSeeker: 7.1/10 and 82% on Rotten Tomatoes sounds good. Can you tell me more about the plot and the main characters?
