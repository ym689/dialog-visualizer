I usually enjoy action, comedy, and maybe some drama. What about you?\nRecommender: That sounds great! I recently watched "Somebody Up There Likes Me" and thought it was a nice light comedy-romance. Would you be interested in checking it out? It stars Nick Offerman and has a pretty good Rotten Tomatoes score of 70%.\nSeeker: 70% isn\'t bad. Can you tell me more about the plot and the characters? I want to make sure it fits my taste.\nRecommender: Sure! The movie follows a man and his best friend as they watch their lives pass them by while both harboring feelings for the same woman. It\'s a heartwarming story with plenty of humor. The lead actor, Nick Offerman, brings a lot of charm to the role.\nSeeker: Sounds interesting. I like the sound of a heartwarming story with humor. Do you know if it\'s got any deep themes or is it more lighthearted?\nRecommender: It\'s definitely more on the lighthearted side, but there are some deeper themes about friendship and missed opportunities. If you\'re looking for something that balances humor with a touch of emotional depth, this could be a good fit.\nSeeker: I think I might give it a try. Thanks for the recommendation!
