What\'s the plot about?\nRecommender: "For Your Consideration" follows three actors who learn that their performances in a film called "Home for Purim" are generating award-season buzz. The movie is directed by Christopher Guest, known for his mockumentary style, which adds a unique twist to the story.\nSeeker: 3 actors vying for awards? That sounds intriguing. How long is the movie? Is it rated PG-13?\nRecommender: "For Your Consideration" runs for 86 minutes and has a PG-13 rating, so it\'s suitable for most audiences.

Can you tell me more about the actors in the movie?\nRecommender: Sure! The main cast includes Catherine O\'Hara, Stephen Rannazzisi, Ed Begley Jr., and Eugene Levy. These actors bring a lot of humor and charm to the film, especially Catherine O\'Hara, who is known for her comedic roles.\nSeeker: I\'ve seen Catherine O\'Hara in " SCTV" and "Groundhog Day."

This response indicates the Seeker is not fully accepting or rejecting the recommendation but is seeking additional details, which falls under "Disinterest."
