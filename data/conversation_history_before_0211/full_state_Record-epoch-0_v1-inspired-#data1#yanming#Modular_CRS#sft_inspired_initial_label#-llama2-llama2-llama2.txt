Do you have any recommendations?\nRecommender: I\'d love to help you find a light-hearted and fun movie. However, I need a bit more information about your preferences. Do you have a preferred era for the movies, for example, classic, recent releases, or something in between?\nSeeker: Ah, good question! I think I\'d like something from the past 10 years or so. I\'ve heard great things about some of the movies from that time period. What do you think? Should I stick with rom-coms or try something else?\nRecommender: I\'ve got a few movies from the past 10 years that might fit the bill. However, I\'d like to know a bit more about your taste in rom-coms. Do you prefer movies with a strong focus on romance, or do you enjoy those with a bit of comedy and adventure mixed in?\nSeeker: I think I like a mix of both, to be honest. I love a good romantic story, but I also enjoy movies that make me laugh. And if there\'s a bit of adventure or excitement, that\'s even better!
